          I got my degree in Management Information System at the University of Texas at Dallas.  I taught tennis throughout school so when I graduated it made sense 
          to continue my career in this profession.  Later on I decided to pursue a career in Management Information System and somehow found my way to being a Desktop
          tech. I have worked in the IT industry for over 15 years.  I went from Desktop Admin to Production Support Admin and to currently a Network Engineer at Frontier 
          Communications. After so many years I have decided to get into coding.
        
          I am an advid golfer.  Any spare time I use it to golf.
